# Std_MaxDrawdown_Calmar
Calculate Standard Error, Max Drawdown and Calmar with Python\n
This is a project previously done as a code test of an interview. \n
ï¼ˆThough finally I gave up the final interview, thought it doesn't match my expectation)\n
So it is mainly a calculator of Standard Error, Max Drawdown and Calmar Ratio with Python programming language, \n
Users may need to import their data as dataframe of pandas, and before that, modify the code block of imported files to the one they need to import.\n
